## Student file policy

All files inside `./R` are considered student files.

### Example

```bash
# Student files
./R/file
./R/subdirectory/file

# Not student files
./root_file
./tests/test_file
```

### Tests

The `tmcRtestrunner` library is included in `./tests` for easy installation during CI.
